## 🔍 Introduction

This repository presents the implementation of a computational workflow designed to construct and evaluate a Profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) focused on a specific protein domain of interest. The project involves generating a structure-based multiple sequence alignment of representative domain-containing proteins, from which an HMM is built and calibrated. The resulting model is tested against both positive (domain-containing) and negative (domain-absent) protein sequences to assess its classification performance. Additionally, a sequence-based HMM—built using an alignment generated by MUSCLE—is developed for comparative evaluation. This analysis aims to highlight the impact of structural information on the sensitivity and specificity of domain detection. The project was carried out as part of a Laboratory in Bioinformatics course during my MSc in Bioinformatics, and integrates principles of structural bioinformatics, statistical modeling, and sequence analysis.

## 📦 Recommended Packages

The pipeline depends on the following bioinformatics tools and libraries, which must be installed before running the workflow. Most of them are available through the conda package manager (via the Bioconda or Conda-Forge channels):

- **CD-HIT**: Groups highly similar protein sequences into clusters to reduce redundancy in input datasets. This ensures that the training set for the HMM is non-redundant.  
  `bash conda install -c bioconda cd-hit`

- **HMMER**: Core tool for building Profile Hidden Markov Models and scanning sequence databases for domain detection. Essential for training and testing the structural HMM.  
  `bash conda install -c bioconda hmmer`

- **BLAST+**: Performs similarity searches (via blastp) to retrieve known homologous sequences or verify hits. Useful for validating HMM predictions.  
  `conda install -c bioconda blast`

- **MUSCLE** (Optional — only needed for sequence-based HMM comparison): Generates multiple sequence alignments from sequence data, used to build the baseline sequence-based HMM for comparison against the structure-based model.  
  `conda install -c bioconda muscle`

- **Biopython**: Required to run `get_seq.py`, a script that extracts specific sequences from FASTA files based on identifiers. Enables automation and parsing of biological data formats.  
  `conda install -c conda-forge biopython`
